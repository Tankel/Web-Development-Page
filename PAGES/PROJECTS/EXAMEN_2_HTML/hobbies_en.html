            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="hobby-container">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>I really enjoy playing music, experimenting, and learning new instruments. Among them, my favorite and the one I'm most skilled at is the piano, which I learned self-taught. I can also play a bit of guitar, ukulele, and saxophone.</p>
                <p>As a musician, I try not to stick to specific genres and listen to as diverse music as possible, but I lean towards Rock, with Radiohead being my favorite band.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hobby-container">
                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>I've been a fan of video games since I was a child, but unfortunately, nowadays, I only get to enjoy playing them during vacations.</p>
                <p>I've tried various types of games, and honestly, I've never been particularly good at genres like shooters or racing games. I enjoy games that demand mental skill, and exploration games are my favorites. My favorite games include "Hollow Knight," "Outer Wilds," and the last two Zeldas (Botw and Totk).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hobby-container">
                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>I've always loved stories, but I find it challenging to get into the reading mood, so I have a long list of books I'd like to read.</p>
                <p>Some of my favorite books are "1984," "Death with Interruptions," and the "Mistborn" series. I also enjoy reading manga, and my favorites include "Vagabond," "Berserk," and "20th Century Boys." Currently, I've delved more into the fantasy genre and am reading "The Way of Kings" by Brandon Sanderson.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hobby-container">
                <h3>Drawing</h3>
                <p>As a child, drawing used to be my main pastime, which I gradually left over time and have been trying to pick up again. Currently, my main interest is drawing with ink and pencil, and I'd like to learn how to draw portraits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hobby-container">
                <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p>I've never been a particularly sporty person, but I've discovered that I really enjoy playing tennis, and despite being a novice, I'd like to continue practicing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hobby-container">
                <h3>Anime</h3>
                <p>I've watched more anime than I'd like to admit, but there are truly many hidden gems in this style of animation. Some of my favorites (which I recommend to anyone who hasn't watched them) include "Attack on Titan," "Steins Gate," and "Osama Ranking."</p>
